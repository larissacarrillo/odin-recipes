    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the Dough</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 1/2 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 cup whole or 2% milk warmed to 110 F</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups + 1 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 large egg room temperature</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh parsley finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>For the Garlic Butter</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh parslet finely chopped</li>
            <li>Flaky sea salt for finishing (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F/180 C. Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 9x13 pan and set it aside. *If using a metal pan, line the bottom with parchment paper and just butter the sides of the dish.</li>
            <li>In a small pot, melt the butter and add the minced garlic. Cook for 1-2 minutes or until the garlic is fragrant. Take off the heat and cool for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a stand mixing bowl, combine the warm milk, sugar, and yeast. Then add the melted garlic butter, egg, flour, salt, and parsley.</li>
            <li>Knead with the dough hook on low speed for 8 minutes. The dough should clean the sides of the bowl, look smooth, and feel super soft and tacky. If the dough is too sticky, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time until you have a workable dough. </li>
            <li>Portion the dough into 12 pieces, each weighing 67 grams.</li>
            <li>Shape each piece into a smooth ball with your hand. Pinch the bottom of the roll to keep it tight. </li>
            <li>Arrange the rolls in your prepared baking pan. Cover the top with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and set it aside to rise for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly beat an egg. Brush the tops of the rolls with the egg wash.</li>
            <li>Bake for 23-25 minutes or until the tops are a nice golden brown.</li>
            <li>While the rolls are baking, make the garlic butter. Melt the butter in a pot and add the minced garlic. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the garlic is fragrant. Then remove it from the heat and stir in the parsley.</li>
            <li>When the rolls come out of the oven, brush them with the garlic butter, sprinkle with sea salt, and enjoy!</li>
